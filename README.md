# Intro to git for DSPG

- `git init`: initialize a respostory
    - only type this once, do not 'nest' your repositories
- `git status`: tells you what is going on

*this* is an italic, and **this is bold**

- `git add` will add a file to the staging area
- `git commit` will take whatever is in the staging area and 
commit it
    - this will open a text editor for you to write your 
message
