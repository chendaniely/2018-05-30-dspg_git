# Intro and branching for DSPG

- `git init`: initialize a respostory
    - only type this once, do not 'nest' your repositories
- `git status`: tells you what is going on

*this* is an italic, and **this is bold**

- `git add` will add a file to the staging area
- `git commit` will take whatever is in the staging area and 
commit it
    - this will open a text editor for you to write your 
message
    - `git commit -m "message"`: will allow you to write a 
commit message in a single line

# Branching in Git

- use `git branch MY_BANCH_NAME` to create a new branch.
- use `git checkout MY_BRANCH_NAME` to go to that branch.
- look at where things are with `status` or `log --oneline --all`

- An automerge happens when you edit a file in different locations
